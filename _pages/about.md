Interviewing for front-end engineering position is hard nowadays. Most of the companies are still on their way to figure out how they should discover front-end talents. As a front-end engineer, you find that **on surface**, the interview questions asked are, most of the times, **NOT** related to front-end work you have been handling on the daily basis. You will be asked to implement a hashCode function, solve a dynamic programming puzzle, etc..I create this site with intentions to:
- Provide interview preparation materials for front-end / full-stack engineers to jump over the hurdles during interview processes
- Help you understand why these big companies ask the questions during an interview of a front-end engineer position and be better prepared when the opportunities come
- Most importantly, grow with you, the audience and contributors here, to become a better software engineer
